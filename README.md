- Note: For make this Arcade Hub closest startup to GTA Online, you have 2 options. Then Navigate to *Your Grand Theft Auto V Directory/scripts/HKH191sBusinessMods/BusinessHelper/Arcade/Arcade.ini*.

1) To make Arcade Hub startup with cheapest owned arcade (like GTA Online user accounts with Twitch Prime), Find and set all presets.

Following Arcade purchasable Locations can be found [here](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Arcades).

#### Unavailable Features

- Unplayable Arcades Inside the Interior.

- Christmas Props.

#### Business Missions

- Setup 1: Not much difference with setup from GTA Online. However, choosing affects difference entrance in setups later.

Note: There's no camera for Main Entrance (Loud) & Waste Disposal for preview.

| Entrance Type | Setup Affection | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Main Entrance | None | Smart Entrance |
| Loading Bay - Using Stockade | Stockade Van required at Setup 2 | Entrance as staff using Stockade Truck |
| Sewer | None | Entrance using sewer |
| Rooftop Right - Using Helicopter | VIP Pass & Helicopter required at Setup 2 & 3 | Entrance using Helpcopter at Right Side of the rooftop |
| Rooftop Left - Using Helicopter | VIP Pass & Helicopter required at Setup 2 & 3 | Entrance using Helpcopter at Left Side of the rooftop |
| Loading Bay - Bugstars | Bugstars Van required at Setup 3 | Entrance using Bugstars Van |
| Main Entrance (Loud) | None | Loud & Dangerous Entrance |
| Waste Disposal | None | Exit Path at the left side of the Casino |

Note: There's no camera for Loading Bay - Bugstars & Waste Disposal for preview.

| Exit Type | Setup Affection | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Main Entrance | None | Normal Exit Path |
| Sewer | Must also set Entrance as Sewer | Escape using Sewer, still Normal Exit Path |
| Rooftop Right - Using Helicopter | Helicopter required at Setup 3 | Escape using Helpcopter at Right Side of the rooftop |
| Rooftop Left - Using Helicopter | Helicopter required at Setup 3 | Escape using Helpcopter at Left Side of the rooftop |
| Loading Bay - Bugstars | Bugstars Van required at Setup 3 | Escape using Bugstars Van |
| Waste Disposal | None | Exit Path at the left side of the Casino |

There's many incompatible setup paths so I don't really recommend to play special setups.

- Setup 2: Depend on Setup 1, All entrances requires Mines & C4 for vault detonation. Besides, for another entrances may have requirement, and they may also give you extra mission to do so.

VIP Pass: Follow the Riata Truck as close as you can so Lester can hack the VIP pass for you.

1) The Riata Truck will always be spawned in front of Casino.
2) By many ways, keeps your vehicles at limited distance is not easy, especial the Riata Truck is moving always fast. So you may fail surprisingly. But don't worry. That won't restart Hack Progress. Instead it will be continued. This very excellent work for its difficulty. You can also do tricks by freeze that vehicle. If you're not in sight of 40 - 150m you will also lose its blip location (marked for player instead).

- Setup 3: This setup is useless because there're default vehicle instead.

1) Ground Getaway Vehicle is an armored Kuruma.
2) Helicopter as Getaway or enter in is a weaponized Buzzard.

- Heist Finale: In case you does not meet incompatible entrance, exit paths & getaway setups, this mission is completable.

- The Third Millennium: Requires player purchase Warehouse from Purchase Options. Big note again, only 14th warehouse are available on the map & radar also able to enter/exit so either purchase or not, player must take to Strawberry Warehouse.
- Pimped Yosemite: Same as *The Third Millennium*.
- 100 for 100: This mission seems useless unless you have time. You will race 100 laps for 100 million.
- Low and Slow: This mission is not easy as it looks. Like you lose the cops but I recommend escape using sewers to avoid every detection so that will be easier. You may also need a bigger map from [Enhanced Native Trainer](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/enhanced-native-trainer-zemanez-and-others) as sample.
